# Reaction Translator

Translating 'reagents and reactants' to 'products'.
The code in this repository is partly based on:
* [Reaction Fingerprints](https://github.com/jnwei/neural_reaction_fingerprint)
* [TensorFlow's Translate Model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/v0.10.0/tensorflow/models/rnn/translate)
* [SMILES Railroad Diagram](https://metamolecular.com/cheminformatics/smiles/railroad-diagram/index.xhtml)
